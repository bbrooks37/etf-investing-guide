            <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-6">
                <p>
                    An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product, i.e., they are traded on stock exchanges. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep their trading price close to their net asset value. Most ETFs are passively managed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of an ETF as a basket of various investments. Instead of buying individual stocks, you buy a share of this basket. For example, an ETF might hold shares of all the companies in the S&P 500 index. When you buy a share of this ETF, you're essentially investing in all 500 companies simultaneously.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-700 mt-8 mb-4">Key Benefits of ETFs:</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Diversification:</strong> By investing in an ETF, you gain exposure to a broad range of assets with a single purchase, reducing risk compared to investing in individual stocks. If one company in the basket performs poorly, its impact on your overall investment is minimized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lower Costs:</strong> ETFs generally have lower expense ratios (annual fees) compared to actively managed mutual funds because most ETFs are passively managed, meaning they track an index rather than relying on a fund manager's expertise to pick stocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Flexibility:</strong> ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, just like individual stocks. This offers more trading flexibility compared to mutual funds, which are typically traded only once a day after the market closes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transparency:</strong> Most ETFs disclose their holdings daily, so you always know exactly what you're invested in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> ETFs often generate fewer capital gains distributions compared to mutual funds, which can be advantageous for taxable accounts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-700 mt-8 mb-4">Common Types of ETFs:</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stock ETFs:</strong> Invest in a basket of stocks, often tracking a specific index (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq 100), industry (e.g., technology, healthcare), or geographic region.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bond ETFs:</strong> Invest in a collection of bonds, providing exposure to various types of debt instruments (e.g., government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Commodity ETFs:</strong> Invest in physical commodities (e.g., gold, silver, oil) or derivatives based on commodity prices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sector ETFs:</strong> Focus on specific industry sectors, allowing investors to target growth in particular areas of the economy.
                    </li>

                        <strong>International ETFs:</strong> Invest in companies or bonds from countries outside your home country.
